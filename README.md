Basic React Template and Tailwind CSS/Flowbite.
Comes with basic firebase start up - but will require API information to be added.


To get started, navigate to root project folder and use:
```
npm install
```
Use this command to resolve one of the dependecy issues.
```
npm install @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object --save-dev
```
```
npm start
```
